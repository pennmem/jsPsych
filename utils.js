Please answer the question below honestly, but for the next question, pick 'never.' The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient—at others, so bewildered and so weak—and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! — We are to be sure a miracle every way—but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting, do seem peculiarly past finding out.\" -Jane Austen<p>" +
